# README

Theme exporting done with terminal.sexy, I mostly use gnome-terminal (home/play) iterm2 (work (wish I could have a linux laptop...))

Best to keep around a .Xresources file those seem to be the most generic

`gruvbox_256palette*` files normally exist in the repo: `~/.vim/plugged/gruvbox` but I'm keeping them here too, they shouldn't change should they ;)
