# Notes from zsh config research

Some notes from building out my dots

## What each file is for...

    * Since `.zshenv` is always sourced, it often contains exported variables that should be available to other programs. For example, $PATH, $EDITOR, and $PAGER are often set in .zshenv. Also, you can set $ZDOTDIR in .zshenv to specify an alternative location for the rest of your zsh configuration.
    * `.zshrc` is for interactive shell configuration. You set options for the interactive shell there with the setopt and unsetopt commands. You can also load shell modules, set your history options, change your prompt, set up zle and completion, et cetera. You also set any variables that are only used in the interactive shell (e.g. $LS_COLORS).
    * `.zlogin` is sourced on the start of a login shell. This file is often used to start X using startx. Some systems start X on boot, so this file is not always very useful.
    * `.zprofile` is basically the same as .zlogin except that it's sourced directly before .zshrc is sourced instead of directly after it. According to the zsh documentation, ".zprofile is meant as an alternative to `.zlogin' for ksh fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired."
    * `.zlogout` is sometimes used to clear and reset the terminal.
